## CREATING THE LOGICAL DIAGRAM OF THE CRUDDUR APP WITH LUCID CHART 

### I created a free trial account on ```lucid.app```  and started exploring the website,it was not hard to get around the website,so it was an easy task for me to achieve,i got to know how to import recent templates and shapes from different cloud platforms like AWS,GCP,Azure and different basic shapes.Below is the screenshot to the logical architectural diagram i created.

## CREATING BUGDET
### i created a budget using the aws cli in gitpod and i was so much fun,i created three .json files in json folder and i understood the contents of the files.I needed to make sure i was in the right account,so i ran the ```aws sts get-caller-identity``` command in the cli and i was in my IAM user account,i set the budget limit amount to $1 in the ```budget.json``` file and changed my email in the ```budget-notifications-with-subscribers.json``` file.Afterwards i ran the following command to create budget
```
aws budgets create-budget \
    --account-id 130566209967 \
    --budget file://aws/json/budget.json \
    --notifications-with-subscribers file://aws/json/budget-notifications-with-subscribers.json
```
