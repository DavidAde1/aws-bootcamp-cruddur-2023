# Week 1 â€” App Containerization

## CONTAINERIZE BACKEND
## Adding dockerfile
### so i created a ```dockerfile``` in the ```/backend-flask``` folder and wrote the following line of codes in the file 
```
FROM python:3.10-slim-buster

WORKDIR /backend-flask

COPY requirements.txt requirements.txt
RUN pip3 install -r requirements.txt

COPY . .

ENV FLASK_ENV=development

EXPOSE ${PORT}
CMD [ "python3", "-m" , "flask", "run", "--host=0.0.0.0", "--port=4567"]
```
### Then i followed the instructions in the docker file and used the ``` cd backend/``` to change the working dirctory and ran the ```pip3 install -r requirements.txt``` command to install the python libraries of the application 
![Installing python libraries](assets/docker-create.png)
### Then i ran the last command,which was ```python3 -m flask run --host=0.0.0.0 --port=4567``` to start up the application on port ```4567``` but i was getting a 404 error but i knew the development server was working since i was seeing the activities on the server 
![starting the server](assets/open-port.png)
### So i set the Environment variables for the frontend and backend of the application to solve the error with the following commands 
```
export FRONTEND_URL="*"
export BACKEND_URL="*"
```
### Now the server is running with some data 
![Server is live](assets/port-running.png)

## BUILD CONTAINER IMAGES OF BACKEND
### I used the following command to build the container image ```docker build -t  backend-flask ./backend-flask``` but i needed to be in the main directory of the application to build a container for ```/backend-flask```
![Build container image](assets/build-container.png)
### Now the container image of ```backend-flask``` would be available in the docker page of my gitpod VSCODE

## RUN CONTAINER
### I used the following command to run the container and set the environment variable of ```FRONTEND_URL & BACKEND_URL```
```
docker run --rm -p 4567:4567 -it -e FRONTEND_URL='*' -e BACKEND_URL='*' backend-flask
```

## GETTING CONTAINER IMAGES AND RUNNING CONTAINER IDS
### I used ```docker images``` command to get the number images in my gitpod and ```docker ps``` to get the running containers in my gitpod

## CONTAINERIZE FRONTEND
## Adding a dockerfile
### So i created a dockerfile in the ```/frontend-react-js``` folder and i wrote the following line of codes in it
```
FROM node:16.18

ENV PORT=3000

COPY . /frontend-react-js
WORKDIR /frontend-react-js
RUN npm install
EXPOSE ${PORT}
CMD ["npm", "start"]
```
![Dockerfile-frontend](assets/dockerfile-frontend.png)

## Build multiple containers
### I created a ```docker-compose.yml``` file in the root folder of the app and i wrote the following codes in the file
```
version: "3.8"
services:
  backend-flask:
    environment:
      FRONTEND_URL: "https://3000-${GITPOD_WORKSPACE_ID}.${GITPOD_WORKSPACE_CLUSTER_HOST}"
      BACKEND_URL: "https://4567-${GITPOD_WORKSPACE_ID}.${GITPOD_WORKSPACE_CLUSTER_HOST}"
    build: ./backend-flask
    ports:
      - "4567:4567"
    volumes:
      - ./backend-flask:/backend-flask
  frontend-react-js:
    environment:
      REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL: "https://4567-${GITPOD_WORKSPACE_ID}.${GITPOD_WORKSPACE_CLUSTER_HOST}"
    build: ./frontend-react-js
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    volumes:
      - ./frontend-react-js:/frontend-react-js

# the name flag is a hack to change the default prepend folder
# name when outputting the image names
networks: 
  internal-network:
    driver: bridge
    name: cruddur
```
![Creating docker-compose](assets/docker-compose.png)

### After creating the docker-compose.ymal file,i went to my terminal and ran the ```cd frontend-react-js/``` command to enter the directory,then i ran the ```npm install``` command.I right-clicked on the ```docker-compose.yml``` file in the parent directory and selected the compose up option,this started two containers(aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023-backend-flask & aws-bootcamp-cruddur-frontend-react-js)
![Multi-containers](assets/multi-containers.png)
### i opened the ```aws-frontend-react-js``` container in my browser and the port ```3000``` was working perfectly but it wasn't communicating with the backend.
![Frontend-working](assets/compose1.png)
### I couldn't get the issue resolved,so i asked for help in the discord server and someone was kind enough to put me through and i got the problem resolved by making ports ```3000``` and ```4567``` visbility from private to public.I used the following commands to achieve this 
```
gp ports visibility 4567:public
gp ports visibility 3000:public
```

## ADDING DYNAMODB LOCAL AND POSTGRES
## Postgres
### I added the following line of codes in my ```docker-compose.yaml``` file to get the postgres container
```
services:
  db:
    image: postgres:13-alpine
    restart: always
    environment:
      - POSTGRES_USER=postgres
      - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password
    ports:
      - '5432:5432'
    volumes: 
      - db:/var/lib/postgresql/data
  ```
  ## Dynamodb local
  ### I also added the following line of codes in my ```docker-compose.yaml``` file to get the dynamodb container
  ```
  services:
  dynamodb-local:
    # https://stackoverflow.com/questions/67533058/persist-local-dynamodb-data-in-volumes-lack-permission-unable-to-open-databa
    # We needed to add user:root to get this working.
    user: root
    command: "-jar DynamoDBLocal.jar -sharedDb -dbPath ./data"
    image: "amazon/dynamodb-local:latest"
    container_name: dynamodb-local
    ports:
      - "8000:8000"
    volumes:
      - "./docker/dynamodb:/home/dynamodblocal/data"
    working_dir: /home/dynamodblocal
    
   ```
  ## I wrote the following lines of code in ```gitpod.yaml``` file to install the docker postgres to my gitpod environment
  ```
   - name: postgres
    init: |
      curl -fsSL https://www.postgresql.org/media/keys/ACCC4CF8.asc|sudo gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/postgresql.gpg
      echo "deb http://apt.postgresql.org/pub/repos/apt/ `lsb_release -cs`-pgdg main" |sudo tee  /etc/apt/sources.list.d/pgdg.list
      sudo apt update
      sudo apt install -y postgresql-client-13 libpq-dev
   ```
   ## I needed to make sure the postgres is working,so i went to the dabase explorer menu in my gitpod environment and made a successful connection with the postgres.Then i ran the following command to run postgres on my machine
  ```psql -Upostgres --host localhost```
